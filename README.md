# random-ideas
Random project ideas that have not been implemented, for the world to see (and perhaps do, if interested!)

*The idea of using issues and tracking via github for ideas was inspired by this project: https://github.com/jbenet/random-ideas*

The goal here is to remove the number of steps from "idea" to actionable effort. Since these problems are all software or text related, putting them directly into github issues makes it easy to discuss, and then immediately move to action, such as creating a repository.

This also has the added benefit of being able to reference the issue, repo, etc... and have a better digital paper trail, rather than keeping notes and ideas in disparate systems locked away on a filesystem or personal account on a productivity app.
